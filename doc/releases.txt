Notes on this document
======================
This is the procedure for cutting a new release of screed. It has been adapted
from the release documentation for the khmer project, found at
http://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/v1.1/release.html.

Getting Started
===============

#. Start with a clean checkout:
    cd `mktemp -d`
    git clone git@github.com:ged-lab/screed.git
    cd screed
#. Install/update versioneer:
    pip install versioneer
    versioneer-installer
#. Review the git logs since the previous release and that ChangeLog reflects
the major changes
#. Review the issue list for any existing bugs that won't be fixed in the
release and ensure they're documented in ``doc/known-issues.txt``
