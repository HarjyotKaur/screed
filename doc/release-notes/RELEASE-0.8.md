# Release v0.8

We are pleased to announce the release of Screed v0.8. Screed is a database
engine capable of storing and retrieving short-read sequence data and is
designed to be fast and adaptable to different sequence file formats.

This version of Screed contains developer documentation for contributing to the
Screed project and a code of conduct for interacting with other contributors
and project maintainers. Documentation is available at
http://screed.readthedocs.org/en/v0.8/

## New items of note:

This release successfully installs and passes its unit tests on
Ubuntu 14.04 and the latest release of Mac OS X 10 "Yosemite". It
also passes the khmer acceptance tests as per the [eelpond testing
protocol.]
(https://github.com/ged-lab/literate-resting/blob/master/kp/README.txt)

This release of screed has renamed the 'accuracy' attribute of read records to
'quality;' this API change will need to be adopted by all users wanting to
upgrade to this version. Unlike the khmer project, Screed is not currently
under semantic versioning. It will be with the 1.0 release.

 - Screed now has automatic compression detection via magic bit sniffing for 
 gzip, bzip files (from @mr-c in #432)
 - Screed now supports streaming of uncompressed FASTA and FASTQ files. Bzip2
 files can also be streamed but not gzip files. (from @mr-c, see #633)
 - Screed now has a Changelog, developer documentation and a code of conduct
 (from @ctb, @mr-c, @bocajnotnef in #625)
 - Versions are now autogenerated using git tags via Versioneer (from
 @bocajnotnef in Screed/#14)
 - Documentation is now autogenerated using Doxygen (from @mr-c in Screed/#13)

## Notable bugs fixed/issues closed:
 - [A khmer script was not accepting reads on the stdin]
      (https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/633) by @mr-c
 - [screed returning the wrong version and breaking dev installs]
      (https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/803) by @mr-c


## Known Issues

These are all pre-existing

 - Screed records cannot be sliced requiring un-Pythonic
 techniques to achieve the same behavior. This will be included in a future
 release. This is being tracked in #768
 - Screed self-tests do not use a temporary directory which causes
 tests run from package-based installs to fail. This is being tracked in #748
 - Screed does not support gzip file streaming. This is an issue with Python
 2.x and will likely *not* be fixed in future releases. This is being tracked
 in #700
